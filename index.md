Conventional video coding and transmission systems are currently based on digital video compression (e.g., HEVC) on a suitable network protocol (802.11, 4G, or 5G) and rely on Shannon separation theorem. However, they suffer from some inherent limitations when the video content is transmitted over wireless error-prone networks. First, the coding choices (compression rate, channel coding rate) are decided a priori and at the transmitter and are the same for all the potential receivers. They could misfit with the actual channel conditions. Some user(s) with degraded channels may undergo digital cliff (glitches or freeze of the video) while other(s) may have a very good channel and yet not taking fully benefit of it since the design choices are based on more pessimistic hypotheses.<br>

Linear Video Coding and Transmission (LVCT) architectures, pioneered by the SoftCast scheme, have demonstrated over the last decade a high potential to address/mitigate the above issues. Such architectures process pixels by successive linear operations and directly transmit information without quantization or coding. This allows receivers to get a decoded video quality commensurate with their channel quality (i.e., graceful degradation), without requiring any feedback information, while avoiding complex adaptation mechanisms. This is a paradigm break with respect to traditional video transmission architectures, which has the potential of dramatically improving the quality of experience in wireless error-prone networks.<br>

In this seminar, a brief presentation of the Univ. Polytechnique Hauts-de-France/ INSA Haut-de-France as well as the IEMN laboratory will be made. The second part of the seminar will be dedicated to the above mentioned LVCT approaches: first, issues with conventional digital schemes (e.g., cliff-effect) will be introduced. Then, a block-by-block description of the components of the baseline SoftCast LVCT scheme will be presented and visual examples provided to facilitate the understanding.<br>
