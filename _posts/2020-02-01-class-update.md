The tutorial lasts for 3 hours and follows the outline presented below:

● Part I (25mn): Introduction <br>
o More and More challenging application contexts <br>
o Current challenges (High Video quality, Low Latency, Mobility) <br>
o Classical solutions/mechanisms for these use-cases <br>
o Alternative: Towards a graceful degradation with LVCT <br>
o Outline of the tutorial 

● Part II (90mn): Baseline LVCT scheme: SoftCast <br>
o Introduction: Issues with conventional digital schemes <br>
o Detailed description of the SoftCast LVCT architecture <br>
o Quality analysis of the LVCT architectures <br>
  ▪ Theoretical analysis <br>
  ▪ Introduction of the visual artifacts <br>
  ▪ Video quality evaluation <br>
o Main variants of the SoftCast LVCT solution

● Break (~15min)

● Part III (25mn): SDR-based Hardware implementations <br>
o From simulation to real implementation <br>
o Current implementation and issues

● Part IV (25mn): Current research challenges <br>
o Improving the coding efficiency (towards hybrid digital-analog schemes) <br>
o Reducing the latency <br>
o Channel adaptation
