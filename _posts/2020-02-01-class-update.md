The tutorial lasts for 3 hours and follows the outline presented below:

● Part I (25mn): Introduction
o More and More challenging application contexts
o Current challenges (High Video quality, Low Latency, Mobility)
o Classical solutions/mechanisms for these use-cases
o Alternative: Towards a graceful degradation with LVCT
o Outline of the tutorial

● Part II (90mn): Baseline LVCT scheme: SoftCast
o Introduction: Issues with conventional digital schemes
o Detailed description of the SoftCast LVCT architecture
o Quality analysis of the LVCT architectures
▪ Theoretical analysis
▪ Introduction of the visual artifacts
▪ Video quality evaluation
o Main variants of the SoftCast LVCT solution

● Break (~15min)

● Part III (25mn): SDR-based Hardware implementations
o From simulation to real implementation
o Current implementation and issues

● Part IV (25mn): Current research challenges
o Improving the coding efficiency (towards hybrid digital-analog schemes)
o Reducing the latency
o Channel adaptation
